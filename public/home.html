            <h3>
                This website is meant to be my personal adaptation of Persona 5's phantom thief aficionado website, technically a fan site forum for the phantom thieves.<br>
                A fair warning to you all, this site currently is in an incomplete state, whilst usable, there will be many missing features that will be added in the future (however long that may be).
                <br><br>
                Here are a few things to keep in mind:
            </h3>
            <ul>
                <li>There is no delete or edit button for posts, once you post something it will remain there until a moderator deletes it</li>
                <li>Currently the user log in system only uses a Username, Password, and a Gender (which for now will remain male and female for simplicity)<br>
                the use of emails will be implemented in the future.</li>
                <li>This is self explanatory, but please be civil within these forums, and strictly refrain from profanity, we will be actively monitoring this website.</li>
            </ul>
